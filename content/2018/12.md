Evaluate the follow expression:

```js
divideByTwo(square(triple(double(increment(1)))))
```

How about that readability, huh?

Developers having used F#, Elixir, Elm (or a bunch of other languages) will be reaching for what's called "the pipeline operator" before you can say Santa Claus.

The pipeline operator allows for a much nicer syntax to the above code, where you start with the first input to the chain of functions, rather than the last function in the chain:

```js
1 |> increment |> double |> triple |> square |> divideByTwo
```

The pipeline operator simply swaps the order from `fn3 fn2 fn1 object` to `object fn1 fn2 fn3`.

If you're familiar with the unix pipe tool (of course you are), you already understand how this works.

## Why do I care?

Because it's coming to JavaScript!

Well, maybe. 

It's currently a TC39 feature proposal in stage 1, meaning it's still considered experimental and that the syntax might very well change before it ends up the language specification.

Considering how this feature is equivalent to how it works in so many other languages, chances are the syntax won't change that much.
