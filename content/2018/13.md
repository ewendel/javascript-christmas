## The function

One can write books about the JavaScript function. I'm sure that people have, too.

But let's rather make this really short. In opposition to other popular languages, like Java, functions in JavaScript are considered higher-order citizens of the language. This means that you can pass them around as arguments, make functions that in turn return new functions, and essentially use them as any other value in the language. For instance, functions may be a property on JavaScript objects (then entitled as methods).

The fact that functions are higher-order citizens in JavaScript, also make them highly flexible. For example, you can create _closures_ in JavaScript:

```
function counter() {
	var count = 0;

	function increment() {
      return ++count;
	}

	return increment;
}

const coolClosureCounter = counter();

coolClosureCounter(); // 1
coolClosureCounter(); // 2

```

## The 6 ways of the function
One of the things that new JavaScripters find confusing is the function declaration. At MDN we find [the definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) of a JavaScript function to be defined as:

> A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ```()```.

But after a while of being acquainted with JavaScript, the statement holds only so far. I present to you, the 6 different ways of declaring a JavaScript function _in 2018_.

**The function declaration/definition/statement**

```javascript
function foo(){
  console.log("Fun with Functions!")
}
```

The first we learn, I guess. This also looks similar to other languages.

**The function expression**

```javascript
const myFunction = function() {
    console.log("Fun with Functions!")
}
```

If you try to reference a function expression before calling it, your code will fail:

```
foo(); // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined

const foo = function() {
    console.log("Hei!");
}
```

**The arrow function expression**

```javascript
() => console.log("Fun with Functions!")
```

After ES6/ES 2015, we also have the handy and petite arrow function expression. This syntax works especially well
when chaining the built-in map/filter/reduce:

```javascript
const names = ['Eirik', 'Nicolai', 'Henrik', 'Jan', 'Paal Kristian', 'Kristine', 'Espen'];
names
  .filter(name => name.length > 5)
  .map(name => name.toLowerCase()) // ["nicolai", "henrik", "paal kristian", "kristine"]
```

However, beware the following before you consider using arrow functions:

- You do not have the special object _arguments_ inside the function body.
- You cannot say `new (() => {})`
- [They do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)

**The function constructor**

Well. This one is not the simplest nor intuitive. It's not recommended by MDN. If you know of a usage, we would love to hear about it!

```javascript
const myStrangeFunc = new Function("a", "console.log(a + ' with Functions')");
myStrangeFunc("Fun"); // Fun with Functions
```

**The others**

...are called (pun intended):

- The generator function expression (function* expression)
- The generator function declaration (function* statement)
- The GeneratorFunction constructor

And will not be subject to this post. [More about this here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions).


## IIFE's and the anonymous function

Functions are pretty cool. And as everything that's cool, it can also be anonymous. In JavaScript, we also allow for unnamed functions. Did you know that you also can invoke them immediately? Say hello to the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):

```javascript
(function () {
    CODE
})();
```
