Untrusted is a fun and quite different browser game. You play by modifying parts of the game's source code, in order to create a path from your characters position to the level goal.
It starts out easy enough, on a map where only a single wall is blocking your path to victory.
On the later stages, you'll probably have a harder time one-shotting your way through the maps (unless you're some sort of genius).

Happy playing!
