From all of us behind _javascript.christmas_, to all of you: Merry Christmas!

For our very last article in this advent calendar, we've made you a JavaScript-themed puzzle.

[Head on over to Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13rFyQ7e4T0ccmpuJ_DS_BSJzdsvrplpWtv5HzeKD0Es/copy) to make your own copy and start looking for the solution.

Have fun, and thanks for following along ❤️

See you next year!
