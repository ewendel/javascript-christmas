title: Don't break the web
lead: JavaScript is the language that makes things happen in the browser nearest to your heart. However, the browsers are many, and the history books of JavaScript long.

There are many years since your (grand) parents grinded on Netscape Navigator, or Internet Explorer was actually used by the people of the web.
Browsers have not always had the same version, and neither have the various web standards.

## Reloading the window in JS
In order to NOT brake existing websites, old syntax has not been removed when new syntax has been added. This makes JavaScript extra funny for experienced developers, but quirky and cumbersome for new ones.

For example, did you know that JavaScript has at least [*500 different ways to reload a window*](http://www.phpied.com/files/location-location/location-location.html)?!

## 10 randomly picked examples

```javascript
location = location
location = window.location['href']
window.location.assign(location)
window.location.replace(location)
self.location.replace(location)
location.href = location
self['location']['assign'](window['location'])
location['reload']()
self.location['href'] = self.location.href
self['location']['href'] = self.location
```

Insane! Or should I say

```javascript
(([][[]]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]])+(([][[]]+[])[+!+[]])+((![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]])+((![]+[])[+!+[]])+(([][[]]+[])[+!+[]])+((!![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]])
```
(hint: run it in the console)

As you can see, these quirks are caused by the fact that the JavaScript language allows for different ways to write in essence equivalent code.
For example, consider:

`location.href = location` versus `location['href'] = location`

where both snippets in practice does the exact same thing.

Discussing which one of the 500+ ways to reload is the best is like discussing wheter you should use Emacs or Vim, or Flow or TypeScript.
The most important thing, I guess, is readabiliy - making sure you and all co-developers understand.

So perhaps not the `self['location']['assign'](window['location'])` part.

Oh, by the way. Almost forgot. Caused by the fresh off-the-shelf [history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History), we now got **even** more ways to reload a window in JavaScript. After all, we don't want to break the web?

Tomorrow, choose one of the 500+ ways to reload the window to get the latest hatch of the JavaScript Christmas calendar.

`window.history.go(0)`, JavaScript !
