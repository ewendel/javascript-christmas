It’s Sunday and the perfect time to waste a few hours at another JavaScript game! 

Elevators are exciting* and that is why [_Elevator Saga: The elevator programming game_](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/) has the potential of consuming your entire afternoon. You play the game by creating an algorithm in JavaScript controlling elevators. The algorithm should transport  people as efficiently as possible to beat challenges of increasing difficulty. You can easily get through the first few challenges with dumb solutions. However, beating all levels requires you to really bring out the big brains.

*Check out the [The Hidden Science of Elevators](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a20986/the-hidden-science-of-elevators/) from Popular Mechanics and I’ll guarantee that you'll agree with me.
